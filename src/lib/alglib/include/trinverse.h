/*************************************************************************
Triangular matrix inversion

The subroutine inverts the following types of matrices:
    * upper triangular
    * upper triangular with unit diagonal
    * lower triangular
    * lower triangular with unit diagonal

In case of an upper (lower) triangular matrix,  the  inverse  matrix  will
also be upper (lower) triangular, and after the end of the algorithm,  the
inverse matrix replaces the source matrix. The elements  below (above) the
main diagonal are not changed by the algorithm.

If  the matrix  has a unit diagonal, the inverse matrix also  has  a  unit
diagonal, and the diagonal elements are not passed to the algorithm.

Input parameters:
    A       -   matrix.
                Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    IsUpper -   True, if the matrix is upper triangular.
    IsunitTriangular
            -   True, if the matrix has a unit diagonal.

Output parameters:
    A       -   inverse matrix (if the problem is not degenerate).

Result:
    True, if the matrix is not singular.
    False, if the matrix is singular.
