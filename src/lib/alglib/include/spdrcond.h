/*************************************************************************
Condition number estimate of a symmetric positive definite matrix.

The algorithm calculates a lower bound of the condition number. In this case,
the algorithm does not return a lower bound of the condition number, but an
inverse number (to avoid an overflow in case of a singular matrix).

It should be noted that 1-norm and inf-norm of condition numbers of symmetric
matrices are equal, so the algorithm doesn't take into account the
differences between these types of norms.

Input parameters:
    A       -   symmetric positive definite matrix which is given by its
                upper or lower triangle depending on the value of
                IsUpper. Array with elements [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    IsUpper -   storage format.

Result:
    1/LowerBound(cond(A)), if matrix A is positive definite,
   -1, if matrix A is not positive definite, and its condition number
    could not be found by this algorithm.
