/*************************************************************************
Utility subroutine performing the "safe" solution of a  system  of  linear
equations with triangular complex coefficient matrices.

The feature of an algorithm is that it could not cause an  overflow  or  a
division by zero regardless of the matrix used as the input. If an overflow
is possible, an error code is returned.

The algorithm can solve systems of equations with upper/lower triangular
matrices,  with/without unit diagonal, and systems of types A*x=b, A^T*x=b,
A^H*x=b.

Input parameters:
    A       -   system matrix.
                Array whose indexes range within [1..N, 1..N].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    X       -   right-hand member of a system.
                Array whose index ranges within [1..N].
    IsUpper -   matrix type. If it is True, the system matrix is the upper
                triangular matrix and is located in the corresponding part
                of matrix A.
    Trans   -   problem type.
                If Trans is:
                    * 0, A*x=b
                    * 1, A^T*x=b
                    * 2, A^H*x=b
    Isunit  -   matrix type. If it is True, the system matrix has  a  unit
                diagonal (the elements on the main diagonal are  not  used
                in the calculation process), otherwise the matrix is
                considered to be a general triangular matrix.
    CNORM   -   array which is stored in norms of rows and columns of  the
                matrix. If the array hasn't been filled up during previous
                executions  of  an  algorithm  with the same matrix as the
                input,  it  will  be  filled  up by the subroutine. If the
                array is filled up, the subroutine uses it without filling
                it up again.
    NORMIN  -   flag defining the state of column norms array. If True, the
                array is filled up.
    WORKA   -   working array whose index ranges within [1..N].
    WORKX   -   working array whose index ranges within [1..N].

Output parameters (if the result is True):
    X       -   solution. Array whose index ranges within [1..N].
    CNORM   -   array of column norms whose index ranges within [1..N].

Result:
    True, if the matrix is not singular  and  the  algorithm  finished its
        work correctly without causing an overflow.
    False, if  the  matrix  is  singular  or  the  algorithm was cancelled
        because of an overflow possibility.

Note:
    The disadvantage of an algorithm is that  sometimes  it  overestimates
    an overflow probability. This is not a problem when  solving  ordinary
    systems. If the elements of the matrix used as the input are close  to
    MaxRealNumber, a false overflow detection is possible, but in practice
    such matrices can rarely be found.
    You can find more reliable subroutines in the LAPACK library
    (xLATRS subroutine ).
